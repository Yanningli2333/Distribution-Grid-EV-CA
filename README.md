# Code for *Impact of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand on Power Distribution Grid Congestion*

The following files pertain to code used to parse data and conduct analysis for the publication titled "Impact of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand on Power Distribution Grid Congestion".  Brief descriptions of the code files are provided below.  Please direct any additional questions or requests to Yanning Li (yspli@ucdavis.edu).

Project outline:

-   01_xx CSTDM data processing at TAZ level
-   02_xx Combine EV Toolbox to CSTDM to get EV trips  
-   03_xx From EV trips to charging events
-   04_xx Assign charging events to feeders
-   05_xx Generate charging profiles from empirical charging records
-   06_xx Calculate aggregate charging load profile on each feeder
-   07_xx Combine grid data (baseload and capacity) with the EV charging load
-   08_xx Scripts to make plots out of results
-   09_xx Upgrade cost calculation
